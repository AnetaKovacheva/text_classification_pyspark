# text_classification_pyspark
In this Notebook, I explore and classify the legal text data, available on Kaggle. The dataset contains legal cases from the Federal Court of Australia. All cases are from 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. Catchphrases, citations sentences, citation catchphrases, and citation classes are captured for each document. Citation classes indicate the type of treatment given to the cases cited by the present case. There are more than 20000 cases in the dataset.  I use PySpark to explore, clean, preprocess, and model the data.
